This token checks if it is being purchased by a Uniswap pool, and in case, makes the purchaser pay a 5% tax which is used to increase the Pool's liquidity on the token side. 

This has an immediate negative impact on the price (because of the unbalance it creates after the tax payment) but has the effect of making the floor price higher, since there are fewer tokens outside the pool.

Moreover, since liquidity is constant on sell-side, this is an up-only-liquidity token
